A D64 file contains a disk image dumped from a Commodore 64 1541 floppy disk. It stores information about a Commodore 64 game or program in D64 format, which consists of 256-byte sectors organized in multiple tracks. D64 files are supported by emulators of Commodore 64 (C64), a popular personal computer from the 1980s.
